# Space Invaders

I love gaming which menas that I also enjoy oldschool arcade games. Another thing I have a very large interest in is game balance and the aspects of 'fairness' in a game. Nowadays games are way too easy so I want to create Space Invaders and make it better.

## The game

The game will be very straight forward - destroy the invaders. I like seeing players progress through a game not because of luck but because of them achieving difficult things. I want to add power-ups that only apply if a certain achievement is hit. These achievements will be hidden from the player to give the game the oldschool feel. 

I will also remove stages, the invaders will keep coming non-stop. There will be no levels and the only score will be for the amount of invaders killed. Stages skew score and don't reflect the player's skill very well in my opinion.

## The game style

I would looooove to be able to reproduce the style of the original game. I will create my own pixel art to make the game original, give the invaders certain colors and shapes depending on the "level" of the invader and the player's ship will also change forms depending on the collected power-ups.

## The tech

This is the one unknown that I have. I'm not sure what tech I want to use and saying that I know everything I want would be a lie. I might use OpenFrameworks because so far it seems pretty easy to use, but I'm considering using OpenGL because I've always wanted to make something with it (no prior experience with OpenGL). I will definitely have sounds so I will have to figure out what sound library to use but other than that I cannot predict what tech stack the game will use.
